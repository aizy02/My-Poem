Toyota Racing Development, a Dream on Wheels and a Mitsubishi Evo 9, A Rally Legend

Today is Toyota Day.
In the world of speed and might,
A Toyota Supra, a pure delight
The GT-R R35 shines so bright.
With a roar that shakes the ground,
In this car, beast power is found.

Tailored and swift, it takes the lead,
Dinosaur!
A marvel of both form and speed.
On the track or city street,
The GT-R is hard to beat.
